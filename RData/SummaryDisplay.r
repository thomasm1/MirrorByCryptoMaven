# HW02: Literature Review
### Initial thinking
### Hypotheses
### Topic of interest 
### Main Research Question
### Literature Review Recap
```
__Initial thinking__:  I'm interested in the psychological elements of parental influence on respondent expectation to go to college. Specifically, I would like to know if working hours (categorical explanatory) during high school is associated with college expectations (categorical response). 

Secondly, I'm interested to see if levels of parental college support/concern (categorical explanatory) during high school is associated with college expectations (categorical response). 

A specific example I'm testing involves whether it is true that very traditional Latino parents, if low-income bracket, encourage males to help the family by working a couple years after graduting high school.  In contrast, females are discouraged from being a "breadwinner."--rather, daughters are encouraged to go directly to college. Therefore, I hypothesize that working Latino Males have lower expectations than others.   

__L__: The college-expectation score (1-5) is based on question, "how likely do you expect to go to college?".   
The parental college concern/support score (1-5) is based on question, "How disappointed do you think your mother/father would be if you did graduate college?"  

__H1__: Working hours (categorical explanatory) during high school is associated with college expectations (categorical response - ExpectCollege).

__H1a__: (categorical explanatory - HoursWorked) negatively associate with college expectation, yet high parental college concern mitigates this effect.

__H2__: High college concern of parent is positively associated with respondant's expectation. 

__H2a__: Parenting college concern mediates the working-in-high-school and expectation-to-go-to-college relationship, especially when conditioned by the intersection of Latino race and Male gender.

__H3__: I hypothesize that the late Wave 4 college graduation outcome variable is negatively associated with working hours in high school.

__MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION__:
Does Parental College Concern moderate the assocation between working hours and college expectation among high school students?

__RQ_1__: What is the relationship between respondent working hours VS respondent expectation to go to college?  

__RQ_2__: What is the relationship between parental college concern VS respondent expectation to go to college?

__RQ-3__: Does low parental concern accentuate the hypothesized association between adolescent-working hours vs college expectation? 
  
__How I did it__: Using Codebook of AddHealth Wave1 literature review via Mendeley, Extensive use of AddHealthW1_CodeBook.pdf

__Literature Review Recap__: Starting with Frank Furstenbur (2000), whose authoritative coverage of adolescence research works with Education-core authors and particular works, including, Stanton-Salazar (1997), Pascarelli (1998), Buchmann (1989), Brooks-Gunn & Graber (1994), Steinberg, Lamborn, Darling & Dornbusch (1994), Entwisle & Alexander (1993).

__Final Lit Note__: Based on the literature, I situate the parental association with students' college expectations within the psychology, education, and sociology peer-reviewed articles around 'family influence'.  More specifically, the publications that frame parental influence in theoretical terms of "Social Control via Family Bonding", i.e., Family Attachment. My research looks at the "dark side" of parental influence rather than the usual "protective factors." I did not find any articles so far on Latino parental conditioning of the working and college expectation relationship.

	Explains that Status Socializaiton Theory (Sewell, haler, and Ohlendorf, 1970) means the notion that future educational success among adolescents is contingent on curent beliefs that such success is desiraable and liked.  This research is guided by The Status Attainment Model (SAM) is the generative model on reproduction of class position across generations, through social-psychoogical process (Morgan, 2005).  "Researchers have suggested that varous factors related to mirnority status are reproudced throughout the social structure and create barriers to high educational attainmnet (Bourdieu and Passeraon, 1973"

	Brookemey explains how to disect the levels of social analysis between the students' family/parental connectedness and school connectedness. In short, the social ecologies of parental-family ecologies and school ecologies.

	Less work has been done on how factors like parental beliefs such as achievement expectation sor efficacy might function as links between socioeconomic status and achievement outcomes... Davis explains how parental SES translates to college-bound beliefs that directly associates with students.

	Status-Attainment Theory (Swelell, et al 1970; Sewell, Haller, and Portes, 1969) [Here as a idealistic value orientation toward education-an educaional aspiration -is an imporant intervening process.  This is further elaborated, contrasted with Resource-constraint theory that educational attainment varies with perceptions of opporutnity structures, evaluated according toe relative direct costs. I look at the motivation part of expectation, so this applies to my research.

#### The faceted plots reveal the high degree of sensitivity White males and females exhibit. Latinos appear comparatively less influenced by parental concern.
#### The results fundamentally contradict the initial hypotheses that  not only proved wrong, but the exact opposite is convincingly demonstrated: Hispanic Males' college expectations remain high despite low parental concern, and their expectations increase with more hours worked (contrary to all other groups). Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected--not for the expected reason--and further, a new alternative hypothesis presents itself: White Males are highly sensitive to parental college concerns, and their expectations actually decrease with more hours worked (contary to Latinos). 
#### Also, at a closer look, the norm among all groups is to decrease expectations for increasing hours working. Yet, Latino males and females increase expectation. 

### Bivariate graphs (both categorical)
#### In the following scenario, Females (2) are compared to Males (1) in their expectations to attend college

##### My personal interpretation of this graph is that the more hours worked, less expectation to attend college. This association is accentuated by male gender. The results appear modest and await statistical testing ahead.

##### My personal intepretation of this tells me that Males (1) are less likely to expect college than females (2), generally speaking. Those working more hours expect to go to college to a lesser degree, and moreso males than females in this respect.  Finally, Looking at parental concern, it has a large effect on expectation to go to college.

### Combined correlation between parental college concern and student's expectation to attend college is .321;This implies that there is a positive relationship, albeit weak correlation. The correlation is stronger for males at .357 than females at .29. This is expected according to the theory that Parental influence is associated with College expectation. 
### Next, the same relationship (corr = .321) is compared by working status. The correlation is stronger for those working (.339) than those not working (.301)
### Next, expectation to attend college 

#### Why is there a difference in the strength of the correlation for everyone compared to either gender separately?  
#####Although the scale is smaller by gender, the correlative association is almost identical at ~.55 or ~.56, Doubling N, leads to combined much stronger .765.  

2. With your previous (or new) two- or three-variable categorical plot, calculate conditional proportions and interpret.
    * (1 p) frequency table of variables is given,
          * It appears that interestingly it is 
    * (2 p) conditional proportion tables are calculated of the outcome variable conditional on one or two other variables,
    * (1 p) a well-labelled plot of the proportion table is given,
    * (2 p) the conditional proportions are interpretted and compared between conditions.
         The tables are less helpful but begin to provide some interesting results in that Expectation to attend college is only a little stronger among those not working.  Similarly it is extremely important to find that there are plenty of self-defining "non-working" students that actually log up to 10 hours working...so now I may have to consider making a subset of specifically working or non-working students. By race, it becomes evident that Natives are much more sensitive to their parents' concern about college at lower levels while White students much less so.

# HW 07: Parameter Estimation - One-Sample $t$-test: `College Expectation` 

* The Add Health design employs a clustered sampling design in which the wider network of in-school surveys comprise the "core" sample, while the "saturated" samples collect in-home information from the entire HS student population. This strategy facilitates the oversampled minority and rare groups, in addition to peer network data enabling social network analysis (SNA). 
* The source of the information is the official website of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health: Social, Behavioral, and Biological Linkages Across the Life Course. http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/faqs/aboutdata
    *  The Wave I stategy employed a stratified, over-sampled design so as to capture sufficient sampling of minority and rare groups. For example, 1038 African American students from well-educated families--with a parent with a college degree. 334 Chinese, 450 Cuban, 437 Puerto Rican.
    *  Potential issues (estimation bias, etc) may be a result of this collection strategy: 
The strategy used to protect against potential sampling issues has a couple of potential bias issues that arise. First, students and parents were alerted beforehand of the date of survey and some parents could have potentially pulled their students thereby self-selection (out) of the sample. 
    * Second, the "saturated" schools--that interviewed every student and parents at the home--were mostly (14 of 16) small-sized (n < 300 students). This type of data doesn't portray most of the stuffy, packed, busy high schools that overrun public schools. The 1994 data also mostly misses the rise and diversity of charter schooling. Besides these petty pedagogical points, the data is nationally representative. 
    * Finally, the Wave four data--when the original 1994-1995 cohort becomes 32-39 years old--collects a smaller sample than the 6504 cases available for the current subset of the study. RQ3 has 3000 cases.
    

2. Using either a numerical variable or a two-level categorical variable, calculate and interpret a confidence interval for the population mean or proportion.
    * The variable of college expectation is the outcome variable of interest. It is a discrete-interval numerical variable along the scale from nominal, ordinal, discrete-interval, and continuous-ratio. In the case of this variable.
    
    * `t.test()` or `binom.test()` used to calculate the mean and confidence interval.   
    * ANSWER: Running a simple t-test, the mean of x is 4.312 and the 95% Confidence Interval lies between 4.274 and 4.35. This is given a t of 223, df of 3002 and p-value < 2.23-16. 
    
    * Confidence interval.  ANSWER: The CI indicates that it is fairly clear that there is a narrow CI. I am confident that such a narrow measurement may be useful to compare with the confidence interval of only those students' expectations with working status (to be investigated below)
    * Plot of the data, estimate, and confidence interval in a single well-labelled plot.

```{R}
t.result <- t.test(addhealth.sub$ExpectCollegeNum, conf.level = 0.95)  #$
t.result
```
The sample mean of the $($College Expectation$)$ is `r signif(t.result$estimate, 3)`.
We are 95% confident that the population mean is between
`r signif(t.result$conf.int[1], 3)` and
`r signif(t.result$conf.int[2], 3)`.

    *   Significance Level. Sample mean of low parental concern (defined as < 4):   `Mu_{non-HPC}` = 3.528.  The `Mu_{HPC}` High Parental Concern group's mean score is 4.46 (expectation to attend college, scale of 1-5). ,the test statistic is t = -14.128.  P-value < 2.2e-16. So we're sure that those that do not have high parental support are between -1 and -.8 difference of mean expectation, at least according to the Welch Two Sample t-test.
    * This is a clear indication justifying the rejecting of the null hypothesis, stating that expecation does not differ between those with high parental college support and those with low parental college support 
    * (1 p) Given your conclusion, could you have committed at Type-I or Type-II error?  ANSWER: Had I done nothing and failed to reject the null--either through complacency or complicity--I would commit a type-II error, that is, to erroneously fail to report a rejected null hypothesis.

    * $H_0: \mu_{Hi-ParConcern} = \mu_{LPC}$ versus $H_A: \mu_{HPC} \ne \mu_{Lo-ParConcern}$

2. Let $\alpha=0.05$, the significance level of the test and the Type-I error probability if the null hypothesis is true.

3. $t_{s} = `r signif(t.summary.Ex$statistic, 4)`$.

4. $p=`r signif(t.summary.Ex$p.value, 3)`$, this is the observed significance of the test.

5. Because $p=`r signif(t.summary.Ex$p.value, 3)` < 0.05$,
    we have sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$, concluding that the
   college expectations do indeed differ by parental college concern.

Final Conclusion: Because I rejected $H_0$ on overwhelming evidence to reject the null, I would have committed a Type-II error (that there is a difference and I failed to announce it to the research community). I also know that there is 3.62?10-e likelihood that I'm committing a type I error--given an alpha coefficient of 05.  (that there is no difference in the mean and my announcement is a spurious finding (which only confuses the research community)).

__Hypothesis test__
1. Set up the __null and alternative hypotheses__ in words and notation.
    * In words: ``The population mean College Expectation is different between the four Student-Situation Groups.''
   Let $\mu_i$ = pop mean Expectation to Attend College in group $i$, $(i=1,2,3,4)$.

3. Compute the __test statistic__.
```{R}
fit.c <- aov(ExpectCollegeNum ~ Studen, data = addhealth.sub)

```

__Hypothesis test__
The $F$-statistic for the ANOVA is $F = `r signif(unlist(summary(fit.c))["ExpectCollegeNum"], 3)`$.
4. Compute the __$p$-value__ from the test statistic.
The p-value for testing the null hypothesis is

6. __Check assumptions__ of the test.

```{R, cache = TRUE}
# Plot the data using ggplot
df.residual <- data.frame(res = aov.summary$residuals)
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(df.residual, aes(x = res))
p <- p + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.2, colour = "white")

p <- p + labs(title = "ANOVA Residuals", x = "Residuals", y = "Density")
print(p)
```
-->
(1 p) Describe the plot of residuals as it relates to model assumptions. ANSWER: ANOVA Model assumptions require that the population have equal spreads evidenced by heavy tails and skews and that the population curve be normal. Since the residuals reveal a relatively normal curve of the sample. In fact, this distribution would almost resemble a sample from a known "normal" population. Comparing the ideal with our own sample distrbution, this is sufficiently normal to proceed.


- Plot the residuals versus the normal quantiles.
  If the residuals are normal, then the will fall on the center line and
  very few will be outside the error bands.

```{R}
# QQ plot
#library(ggplot2)
#install.packages("car")
#library(car)
#par(mfrow=c(1,1))
#qqPlot(aov.summary$residuals, las = 1, id.n = 0, id.cex = 1, lwd = 1, main="QQ Plot")
#Previous line will not knit due to $ operator will not with atomic vector...
```

(1 p) Describe the plot of residuals as it relates to model assumptions.
ANSWER: So, here the distribution looks not very normal with substantial outliers at the both tails. 

- A formal test of normality on the residuals tests the hypothesis
  $H_0:$ The distribution is Normal vs
  $H_1:$ The distribution is not Normal.
We can test the distribution of the residuals.

Three tests for normality are reported below.
I tend to like the Anderson-Darling test.  Different tests have different properties, and
  tests that are sensitive to differences from normality in the tails of the
  distribution are typically more important for us (since deviations in the tails
  are more influential than deviations in the center).

```{R, cache = TRUE}
shapiro.test(fit.c$residuals)
#install.packages("nortest")
library(nortest)
ad.test(fit.c$residuals)
cvm.test(fit.c$residuals)
```

(1 p) Interpret the conclusion of the Anderson-Darling test: Firstly, we can use the test because there is a heavy left and heavy right tail, or any other problem.  The AD test reveals the P-value is <2.2e-16. This is problematic because the residuals are not normal, so no need for other tests. In this case, we want to accept the null hypothesis, as we desired > .05 for p-value.

* Check whether populations have equal variances. Look at the numerical summaries below.

```{R, cache = TRUE}
# calculate summaries 
library(plyr)
addhealth.sub.summary <- ddply(addhealth.sub, "RaceEth",
     function(X) { data.frame( m = mean(X$ExpectCollegeNum),
                              s = sd(X$ExpectCollegeNum),
                               n = length(X$ExpectCollegeNum) ) } )
addhealth.sub.summary
```
The standard deviation is higher among Latinos, while they are also the lowest mean along with Natives. The SD of Whites, Natives are then slightly less, and that of Blacks is lower. Asians have lowest standard deviation and Asians lowest SD and highest mean college expectation. 

Formal tests for equal variances.
We can test whether the variances are equal between our three groups.
This is similar to the ANOVA hypothesis, but instead of testing means we're tesing variances.
$H_0: \sigma^2_1=\sigma^2_2=\sigma^2_3$
versus $H_A: \textrm{not } H_0$ (at least one pair of variances differ).
```{R, cache = TRUE}
## Test equal variance
# assumes populations are normal
bartlett.test(ExpectCollegeNum ~ ParenConcernMean, data = addhealth.sub)

# does not assume normality, requires car package
library(car)
leveneTest(ExpectCollegeNum ~ ParenConcernMean, data = addhealth.sub)

# nonparametric test
fligner.test(ExpectCollegeNum ~ ParenConcernMean, data = addhealth.sub)
```
If normality was reasonable then use Bartlett, otherwise use Levene. Therefore, using the Bartlett (in spite of non-normal distribution) the test indicates p-value of .<2.2e-16. (P-value is derived from 'area under the chi-squared curve to the right of B obs.) In this case again we do regrettably need to to reject the null hypothesis (which means non-normality). 
Next, then the Leven test (which does not assume normality), is then applied indicating a Pr(>F) at <2.2e-16, with n of 3018.[[Not sure of the deeper meaning yet]]. Finally, the Fligner-Killeen Test of homogeneity of variances yields same p-value of <2.2e-16, with degrees of freedom df = 8, chi-squared of 388.23. 

7. Since the ANOVA null hypothesis was rejected, I perform the follow-up Post Hoc pairwise comparison tests to determine which pairs of means are different.

There are several multiple comparison methods described in the notes.
Let us use Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD) here to test which pairs of populations differ.
```{R, cache = TRUE}
## Add Health
# Tukey 95% Individual p-values

##Low Concern,Work-Low Concern,Not Work      0.4848930
##Low Concern,Work-High Concern,Work         0.0000000
The differing pairs can be compared: According to Tukey's Honest Signicant Difference test, We see the three comparisons of the three groups, and clearly the pairs with a 'High Concern,Work-High Concern,Not Work' are not hardly different at -0.0083 difference (Not working has slightly higher expectation).  Yet we see large differences between the high concern versus low concern. Thus pairs involving high and low concerns are most notably different (.99 high over low, both working).

Ordering the means and grouping pairs that do not differ (see notes for examples).

  Example:  [low concern and working] AND [high concern and working] groups differ, but group pairings with equal "concerns" do not differ.
    (These groups are ordered by mean, so Low Concern-Working has the lowest mean and High Concern-Not Working has the highest mean college expectation.)
These groups are ordered by mean, so that Low Concern,Work is lowest, and NotWork-high Concern is highest:
  Work-High Concern,NotWork-high Concern | Low Concern,Work versus High Concern,Not Work
                    
------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------
    Low Concern-Work, | Low Concern-Non Work,| High Concern-Work,| High Concern,Not Work
------------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------



# HW 10 Multinomial Tests and Goodness of Fit
## Setting up Expected and Observed Frequencies
1. Using a categorical variable with three to five levels (or a categorical variable you can reduce to three to five levels),
  specify an multinomial goodness-of-fit hypothesis associated with your research questions.
    * Specify the goodness-of-fit hypotheses in words and notation, I expect that the distribution of expectation to attend college would be proportionate to population. 
    * Plot the data in a way that is consistent with hypothesis test (comparing observed and expected proportions),
    * Use `chisq.test()` to calculate the hypothesis test statistic and p-value,
    * State the significance level, test statistic, and p-value,
    * State the conclusion in the context of the problem, and
    * Assess the assumptions of the test.
    * Plot the contribution to Chi-sq statistic and comment on which groups deviate the most from expected.
    * If you rejected the goodness-of-fit null hypothesis, perform follow-up pairwise comparisons using one-sample proportions tests to indicate which groups have statistically different proportions (using Bonferroni to control the Familywise Error Rate) and summarize the results.  Otherwise, simply indicate that you did not reject the null hypothesis. 
    Under an assumption of probability distribution of being one of four student types (at least at the time of survey), by race-ethnicity.

Plot observed vs expected values to help identify `n.Studen` groups that deviate the most.
Plot contribution to chi-square values to help identify `n.Studen` groups that deviate the most.
The term ``Contribution to Chi-Square'' (`chisq`) refers to the values of
  $\frac{(O-E)^2}{E}$ for each category.
$\chi^2_{\textrm{s}}$ is the sum of those contributions.

## Multiple Comparisons
The goodness-of-fit test suggests that at least one of the `n.Studen` category type
proportions for the observed number of student types differs from the expected number of student type proportions.  A reasonable next step in the analysis would be to __separately__ test
the four hypotheses:
$H_0: p_{4} = `r signif(exp.prop[1], 3)`$,
$H_0: p_{5} = `r signif(exp.prop[2], 3)`$,
$H_0: p_{6} = `r signif(exp.prop[3], 3)`$, and
$H_0: p_{7} = `r signif(exp.prop[4], 3)`$ to see which `n.Studen` types led to this conclusion.

A Bonferroni comparison with a Family Error Rate $\alpha=0.05$
  sets each test's significance level to $\alpha = 0.05 / 4 = `r signif(0.05/4, 3)`$,
  which corresponds to `r signif(100 * (1 - 0.05/4), 4)`% two-sided CIs
  for the individual proportions.

Below I perform exact binomial tests of proportion for each of the four `n.Student` category types
  at the Bonferroni-adjusted significance level.I save the p-values and confidence intervals in a table along with the  observed and census proportions in order to display the table below.
```{R}
b.sum1 <- binom.test(frame.Studen$obs[1], sum(frame.Studen$obs), p = frame.Studen$exp.prop[1], alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 1-0.05/4)
b.sum2 <- binom.test(frame.Studen$obs[2], sum(frame.Studen$obs), p = frame.Studen$exp.prop[2], alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 1-0.05/4)
b.sum3 <- binom.test(frame.Studen$obs[3], sum(frame.Studen$obs), p = frame.Studen$exp.prop[3], alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 1-0.05/4)
b.sum4 <- binom.test(frame.Studen$obs[4], sum(frame.Studen$obs), p = frame.Studen$exp.prop[4], alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 1-0.05/4)
# put the p-value and CI into a data.frame
b.sum  <- data.frame(
            rbind( c(b.sum1$p.value, b.sum1$conf.int)
                 , c(b.sum2$p.value, b.sum2$conf.int)
                 , c(b.sum3$p.value, b.sum3$conf.int)
                 , c(b.sum4$p.value, b.sum4$conf.int)
            )
          )
names(b.sum) <- c("p.value", "CI.lower", "CI.upper")
b.sum$n.Studen <- frame.Studen$n.Studen
b.sum$Observed <- x.table$obs/sum(x.table$obs)
b.sum$exp.prop <- frame.Studen$exp.prop
b.sum
```

(2 p) Conclusions of the four hypothesis tests above.
(Note that the p-value is your guide here, not the CI.)

```{R}
# Observed vs Expected proportions
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(b.sum, aes(x = n.Studen, y = Observed))
# observed
p <- p + geom_point(size = 4)
p <- p + geom_line(aes(group = 1))
p <- p + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI.lower, ymax = CI.upper), width = 0.1)
# expected
p <- p + geom_point(aes(y = exp.prop), colour = "red", shape = "x", size = 6)
p <- p + geom_line(aes(y = exp.prop, group = 1), colour = "red")
p <- p + labs(title = "Observed (w/98.75% CI) and Expected (red x) proportions")
p <- p + xlab("Student Type")
p <- p + expand_limits(y = 0)
print(p)
```

The distribution of Latino students indicates higher than usual proportions of working, and parents with higher than usual college concerns.

## Hypothesis test for Homogeneity of Proportions (categorical association)
 * (1 p) Specify the hypotheses in words and notation.
__null and alternative hypotheses__ in words and notation.
    * In words: ``There is an association between [Working Status] and [ExpectCollege].''
    * In notation: $H_0: p(i-College Expectation \textrm{ and } j-Working Status) = p(i)p(j)$ versus $H_A: p(i-College Expectation \textrm{ and } j-Working Status) \ne p(i)p(j)$, for all row categories $i$ and column categories $j$.
      The probability of row category, College Expectation, $i$ are conditional on column category, Working Status $j$,
        $p(i|j) = p(i)$, does not depend on which column category $j$ we consider.
        
__significance level__ of the test is $\alpha=0.05$.
* (1 p) State the conclusion of the test in the context of the problem.
  
__test statistic__of homogogeneity of proportions is $\chi^2$. 
  * $X>^2$ = 4.934 meaning that p-value is .2941.  
  * So we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0=no diff) This means that they have the same expectations, no matter if they work or not... (unlike the condition ofparental concern)

__$p$-value__ .2941 from the test statistic
  with degrees of freedom,  $df = (5-1)(2-1) = 4$,
  where $5$ and $2$ are the number of rows and columns.
__conclusion__ in terms of the problem.
    * The test fails to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_A$ if $p\textrm{-value} < \alpha$.
    * The test fails to reject $H_0$ because $p\textrm{.2941} \ge \alpha$.
   
__Check assumptions__ of the test: The expected count for each cell is at least 5

## sum of the frequencies and column proportions.
The column proportions are interpreted as the proportion of students' College Expectations conditional on Working Status.
If these column proportions are roughly the same for each Grade,
  then that's an indication of no association.
```{R}
# Tabulate by two categorical variables:
tab.ExpectCollegeWorking <- xtabs(~ ExpectCollege + Working, data = addhealth.sub)
tab.ExpectCollegeWorking

# column proportions
prop.table(tab.ExpectCollegeWorking, margin = 2)
```

```{R}
chisq.gg <- chisq.test(tab.ExpectCollegeWorking, correct=FALSE)
chisq.gg
  # names(chisq.gg) for the objects to report
```
__test statistic__, such as $X^2$. The test statistic is $X^2 = `r signif(chisq.gg$statistic, 3)`$. The p-value $= `r signif(chisq.gg$p.value, 3)`$.  $X>^2$ = 4.934 meaning that p-value is .2941.  So we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0=no diff) This means that they have the same expectations, no matter if they work or not...
__conclusion__ in terms of the problem.  ANSWER: $X>^2$ = 4.934 meaning that p-value is 0.2941  So we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0=no diff) This means that they have the same goals, no matter the grade level, with 95% confidence. 
__Check assumptions__ of the test
  Expected count for each cell is at least 5, or at least 1 provided the expected counts are not too variable. 
  
```{R}
# table of expected frequencies:
chisq.gg$expected
# smallest expected frequency:
min(chisq.gg$expected)
```
Model assumptions met? ANSWER: No problem, the smallest group (Not working with an Expectation of 2) has 44. Yes, the assumptions are met.
## Deviations details
Since I rejected the null hypothesis above, the Pearson residuals are a way to 
  indicate which cells of the table were different from expected.
Residuals more extreme than roughly $\pm 2$ are considered ``large''.
```{R}
# The Pearson residuals
chisq.gg$residuals
# The sum of the squared residuals is the chi-squared statistic:
chisq.gg$residuals^2
sum(chisq.gg$residuals^2)
```
__the Pearson residuals__. The sum of the squared residuals ($X^2$ is 4.93. This is much more than $\pm 2$, so the residuals are too large. Further, when looking by group, I see that the largest individual residual contribution is .98 among those that have a "3" expectation to attend college and do not work $\pm .4$ )

The mosaic plot is a visual representation of the observed frequencies (areas of each box) and the Pearson residual (color bar).
If rectangles are the same size along rows and columns (and gray),
  then they're close to expected.
Differences between observed and expected frequencies are indicated by
  different sized rectangles across rows or down columns and
  colors indicate substantial contributions to the $X^2$ statistic.

```{R}
# mosaic plot
#install.packages("vcd")
library(vcd)
mosaic(tab.ExpectCollegeWorking, shade=TRUE, legend=TRUE)
# this layout gives us the interpretation we want:
mosaic(~ ExpectCollege + Working, data = addhealth.sub, shade=TRUE, legend=TRUE, direction = "v")
```
  * (1 p) Plot a mosaic plot of the data and Pearson residuals.
    * (1 p) Interpret the mosaic plot with reference to the Pearson residuals.
__mosaic plot__ The plot clearly indicates there is something about the those that are not working and marked a "3" or "2", but apparently not enough to be substantively significant to reject the Pearson Chi-Square test of homogeneity of proportions.


## Second Homogeneity Test:
## College Expectation vs Student Type (working/parental concern)
_Repeat the analysis above, but compare student type instead of Working Status._

```{R}
# Tabulate by two categorical variables:
tab.ExpectCollegeStuden <- xtabs(~ ExpectCollege + Studen, data = addhealth.sub)
tab.ExpectCollegeStuden

# column proportions
prop.table(tab.ExpectCollegeStuden, margin = 2)
```

1. __null and alternative hypotheses__ in words and notation.
    * In words: ``There is an association between [College Expectation] and [Studen Type].''
    * In notation: $H_0: p(i \textrm{ and } j) = p(i)p(j)$ versus $H_A: p(i \textrm{ and } j) \ne p(i)p(j)$, for all row categories $i$ and column categories $j$.

2. Choose the __significance level__ of the test, such as $\alpha=0.05$.

```{R}
chisq.es <- chisq.test(tab.ExpectCollegeStuden, correct=FALSE)
chisq.es
  # names(chisq.ga) for the objects to report
```
The test statistic is $X^2 = `r signif(chisq.es$statistic, 3)` = 343$. The p-value $= `r signif(chisq.es$p.value, 3)`$ < 2.2e-16

__conclusion__ in terms of the problem. ANSWER: Thus, given that the p-value is <.05, and even <.001, and thus reason to believe there is association between the college expectations and student type [parental college concern/working status] in statistically significant terms.
provided the expected counts are not too variable).

```{R}
# table of expected frequencies:
chisq.es$expected
# smallest expected frequency:
min(chisq.es$expected)
```
__model assumptions__ Luckily, the model assumptions are met because the lowest expected cell count is >5, at 8 (cutting it close, there). 


## Deviations details
Since I rejected the null hypothesis above, the Pearson residuals are a way to
  indicate which cells of the table were different from expected.
Residuals more extreme than roughly $\pm 2$ are considered ``large''.
```{R}
# The Pearson residuals
chisq.es$residuals
# The sum of the squared residuals is the chi-squared statistic:
chisq.es$residuals^2
sum(chisq.es$residuals^2)
```
__Pearson residuals__ Having rejected the null hypothesis, certifying there is at least one significant difference, we look and find several combinations where college expectation and student type are greater than $\PM  2$, at up to 8.59 (low concern-working that have a '1' expectation).  


The mosaic plot is a visual representation of the observed frequencies (areas of each box)
  and the Pearson residual (color bar).
If rectangles are the same size along rows and columns (and gray),
  then they're close to expected.
Differences between observed and expected frequencies are indicated by
  different sized rectangles across rows or down columns and
  colors indicate substantial contributions to the $X^2$ statistic.
```{R}
# mosaic plot
#install.packages("vcd")
library(vcd)
mosaic(tab.ExpectCollegeStuden, shade=TRUE, legend=TRUE)
# this layout gives us the interpretation we want:
mosaic(~ ExpectCollege + Studen, data = addhealth.sub, shade=TRUE, legend=TRUE, direction = "v")
```
__mosaic plot__ The plot indicates there is an above average number of low-concern/working or non-working students that have a 5/5 college expectation

Plot data for `Age` vs `ParenConcernNum` by race-ethnicity--I see that as the students age, their parental concerns seem lower... Next, I look at data for `ParenConcernNum` vs `ExpectCollegeNumLog` also by race-ethnicity.  I find from this data that some groups have more sensitivity in college expectations to parental concern than others. 
 (1 p) Plot the data and, if required, transform the variables so a roughly linear relationship is observed.  All interpretations will be done on this scale of the variables.
__Choose either Females or Males for the remaining analysis.__

```{R}
# choose one:
#addhealth.sub.use <- subset(addhealth.sub, (Working == "Not Working"))
# addhealth.sub.use <- subset(addhealth.sub, (Working == "0"))
#summary(addhealth.sub.use)
```

__Plan:__
Center the explanatory variable `HoursWorked`,
  fit a simple linear regression model,
  check model assumptions,
  interpret the parameter estimate table, and
  interpret a confidence and prediction interval.

## Center the explanatory variable `ParenConcernMean`

Recentering the $x$-variable doesn't change the model,
  but it does provide an interpretation for the intercept of the model.
For example, if you interpret the intercept for the regression lines above,
  it's the "expected height for a person with a hand span of zero",
  but that's not meaningful.

Choose a value to center your data on.
A good choice is a nice round number near the mean (or center) of your data.
This becomes the value for the interpretation of your intercept.

__normality assumption__
If the normality assumption seems to be violated, perform a normality test on the standardized residuals.   The data does not look very normal based on the skewed distribution of residuals.
* (1 p) Assess the residuals for lack of fit (interpret plots of residuals vs fitted and $x$-value). The residuals do not follow a patter
* (1 p) Assess the residuals for normality (interpret QQ-plot and histogram). Big lower tail on the QQ plot, while the historgram reveals a clear skew illustrated by the tail.

* (1 p) Test whether the slope is different from zero, $H_A: \beta_1 \ne 0$.
* (1 p) Interpret the $R^2$ value.
__residuals versus the fitted values__
Do the residuals versus the fitted values and `College Expectation` values appear random?
Or is there a pattern?  There is a faint skew to the left, otherwise, it's satisfactoriarily normal and randomly distributed 


## Investigate the relative influence of points

_Leverages and Cook's Distance__: There are recommendations for what's considered large,
  for example, a $3p/n$ cutoff for large leverages,
  and a cutoff of 1 for large Cook's D values.
I find it more practical to consider the relative
  leverage or Cook's D between all the points and
  worry when there are only a few that are much more influential than others.

Here's a plot that duplicates a plot above.
Here, the observation number is used as both the plotting point and a label.
```
```{R}
# plot diagnistics
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plot(influence(lm.fit)$hat, main="Leverages", type = "n")
text(1:nrow(addhealth.sub), influence(lm.fit)$hat, label=paste(1:nrow(addhealth.sub)))
  # horizontal line at zero
  abline(h = 3*2/82, col = "gray75")

plot(cooks.distance(lm.fit), main="Cook's Distances", type = "n")
text(1:nrow(addhealth.sub), cooks.distance(lm.fit), label=paste(1:nrow(addhealth.sub)))
  # horizontal line at zero
  abline(h = 1, col = "gray75")
```
* (1 p) Assess the relative influence of points. The points are clearly skewed raising new questions about transforming it by square or log...
__leverages and Cook's D__
Interpret the leverages and Cook's D values with respect to whether
  any observations are having undue influence on model fit.  Looking at Cook's D and the Leverage test, I'd say there's nothing extradornary (especially given the very liberal use of treating a combined score, fa & pa, of ten points along a continuous scale) It is apparent that one particular case, #5 exerts somewhat high leverage and about a half dozen supass the .07 point. Regarding the Cook's D, it is apparent that #5 is an outlier. These indicate undue influence and should be removed from the dataset to see if they improve the R of the model. If not, there is not apparent gain from deleting them. 


## Interpret the parameter estimate table
Here's the parameter estimate table.

We're estimating the $\beta$ parameter coefficients in the regression model
  $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + e_i$.

```{R}
summary(lm.fit)
```

Assuming the model fits well, complete this equation
  (fill in the $\beta$ values with values from the table)
  with the appropriate numbers from the table above
  (3 numbers: each beta and the HandSpan centering value).

The regression line is
  $\hat{\textrm{College Expectation}} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \textrm{(Hours Worked)}$.
The model fits great and the F-statistic is 13.42--plenty. 

State the hypothesis test related to the slope of the line,
  indicate the p-value for the test,
  and state the conclusion.

Words and notation:

* Words: I hypothisze in the positivie association. Therfore, null hypothesis that no relation between the height and handspan, while the alternate allows for this difference.
* Notation: $H_0:\beta_Handspan = 0$ vs $H_A:\beta_Handspan \ne 0$

Interpretion of the slope coefficient in the context of the model.
The slope of beta is .917, which indicates positive association at p-value < .05
State and interpret the $R^2$ value.
The R^2 is the explained portion of the model: It is .316 (.29 adjusted for df) means that 30% of the relationship is explained by this model. 

## Interpret a confidence and prediction interval

Below is a 95% confidence interval for the mean (the regression line)
  and a prediction interval for a new observation
  at $\textrm{Parental College Concern} = -1$.
See how these match up with the plot above.

```{R}
predict(lm.fit, data.frame(ParenConcernNum = -1)
      , interval = "confidence", level = 0.95)
predict(lm.fit, data.frame(ParenConcernNum = -1)
      , interval = "prediction", level = 0.95)
```

__Interpretion the CI__:The CI is between 2.190124 2.600762 which means that we have that confidecne at alpha = .05. 

__Interpretion the PI__: THe PI, or predictive interval is necessarily wider as this is between 0.4068382 4.384048  This is the 95% confidence in predicting a future observation between these bounds: THis is a forecast in the greatest sense of the meteorological meaning: Prediction between .4 and 4 basically covers a large portion of students.









# HW 12 Logistic Regression
## AddHealth Wave 1 (& inclusion of Wave 4 Ed Outcome DV: College Graduation)

__Research question:__
Is there a relationship between attaining a BA and Hours Worked During a Typical Non-Summer Week during High School?
__Intuition:__
I expect that number of working hours during high school will have a harmful effect on academic efforts. Results indicated that increased working hours increase likelihood of graduating college--most notably, college graduation probability increases for those working 30 hours over those working 20; further, BA probability improves for those who worked 20 hours over those working less than five. 


## Data

Plots on the probability scale should follow a sigmoidal curve
  (a little difficult to see here).
Note that the overlayed reference
  curve (red) is a weighted smoothed curve (loess),
  not the model fit.
  
NOTE: Interesting that the predicted probability trends form .81 to .38 from age 12 AVG and 22 AVG.So, the intuitive findings are validated here.
```{R}
#library(ggplot2)
#p <- ggplot(df.ExpectCollegeNum.gradBA.sum, aes(x = ExpectCollegeNum, y = p.hat))
#p <- p + geom_point(aes(size = Total))
#p <- p + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, colour = "red", aes(weight = Total))  # just for reference
#p <- p + expand_limits(y = 0) + expand_limits(y = 1)
#p <- p + labs(title = "Observed probability of college graduation")
#print(p)
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(df.HoursWorked.gradBA.sum, aes(x = HoursWorked, y = p.hat))
p <- p + geom_point(aes(size = Total), color = "brown")
p <- p + geom_point(position = position_jitter(width=0.3), colour = "orange")

p <- p + labs(title = "Observed probability of college graduation")
print(p)
```

On the logit scale, if points follow a straight line,
  then we can fit a simple linear logistic regression model.
Note that the overlayed reference
  straight line (blue) is from weighted least squares (not the official fitted line),
  and the curve (red) is a weighted smoothed curve (loess).
Both lines are weighted by the total number of observations that each point represents,
  so that points representing few observations don't contribute as much as
  points representing many observations

    * (1 p) Describe the logit-vs-$x$ plot.  Is it linear?  If not, consider a transformation of $x$ to improve linearity; describe the transformation you chose if you needed one. ANSWER: the points are not very linear. and if anything I would log the findings. I already removed the "zeros" moreso for theory reasons rather than methodological: I'm interested in working hours, not working per se.  
The points do not indicate a very straight line.

* (1 p) Describe the logit-vs-$x$ plot.  Is it linear?  If not, consider a transformation of $x$ to improve linearity; describe the transformation you chose if you needed one.
ANSWER: In my opinion, a straight line would sufficiently well (not optimal).  There are details that are missed by a linear model, such as the apparent double-se,  inverse "S" curve.
```

## Simple logistic regression model

The simple logistic regression model expresses the population proportion $p$ of
individuals with a given attribute (called the probability of success) as a
function of a single predictor variable $X$. The model assumes that $p$ is
related to $X$ through
$$
\log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
$$
or, equivalently, as
$$
p = \frac{ \exp( \beta_0 + \beta_1 X ) }{ 1 +  \exp( \beta_0 + \beta_1 X ) }.
$$
The logistic regression model is a __binary response model__, where the
response for each case falls into one of two exclusive and exhaustive
categories, success (cases with the attribute of interest) and failure (cases
without the attribute of interest).

Fit the model.

```{R}
# For our summarized data (with frequencies and totals for each age)
# The left-hand side of our formula binds two columns together with cbind():
#   the columns are the number of "successes" and "failures".
# For logistic regression with logit link we specify family = binomial,
#   where logit is the default link function for the binomial family.

# first-order linear model
#glm.p.a <- glm(cbind(Success, Total - Success) ~ ExpectCollegeNum, family = binomial, df.ExpectCollegeNum.gradBA.sum)
glm.p.a <- glm(cbind(Success, Total - Success) ~ HoursWorked, family = binomial, df.HoursWorked.gradBA.sum)
```

```{R, echo=FALSE}
# # Note that this method where every observation is distinct
# #   gives the same parameter estimates,
# #   but the deviance statistic for assessing lack-of-fit is not correct
# #   because it treats every observation as a "category" rather than each age category.
# # Above, using the summarized data gives the appropriate lack-of-fit test.
#glm.p.a <- glm(EverPreg ~ AgeAtVag, family = binomial, df.piv.preg)
#summary(glm.p.a)
#
# ## INCORRECT FOR UNSUMMARIZED DATA
# # Test residual deviance for lack-of-fit (if > 0.10, little-to-no lack-of-fit)
# glm.p.a$deviance
# glm.p.a$df.residual
# dev.p.val <- 1 - pchisq(glm.p.a$deviance, glm.p.a$df.residual)
# dev.p.val
```

## Deviance statistic for lack-of-fit

Unfortunately, there aren't many model diagnostics for logistic regression.
One simple test is for lack-of-fit using the deviance.
Under the null hypothesis (that you'll state below),
  the residual deviance follows a $\chi^2$ distribution with
  the associated degrees of freedom.
Below we calculate the deviance p-value and perform the test for lack-of-fit.

```{R}
# Test residual deviance for lack-of-fit (if > 0.10, little-to-no lack-of-fit)
glm.p.a$deviance
glm.p.a$df.residual
dev.p.val <- 1 - pchisq(glm.p.a$deviance, glm.p.a$df.residual)
dev.p.val
#
```

__(1 p)__
State the null hypothesis for lack-of-fit.
ANSWER: Null Hypothesis:  the residual deviance follows a $\chi^2$ distribution with  the associated degrees of freedom. Null means the model does not fit: lack of fit. $H0:$ The residual deviance < .1, thus lack of fit. $HA:$>.1 little-to-no lack-of fit.  

__(1 p)__
For your preferred model, the deviance statistic is $D=10.07$ with $9$ df.The p-value =.344. This means the model fits the data well. 

__(1 p)__
What is your conclusion for the model fit? Given the p-value, .344, is greater than .10 which indicates there is not an issue with lack of fit. (So, we reject null and we have sufficient information to believe we can model the data with a logistic regression.

## Visualize and interpret the model
```
The `glm()` statement creates an object which we can use to create
  the fitted probabilities
  and 95\% CIs for the population proportion at diffiner College Expectation.
The fitted probabilities and the limits are stored in columns labeled
  `fitted.values`, `fit.lower`, and `fit.upper`, respectively.
 * (1 p) Fit the `glm()` model and assess the deviance lack-of-fit test.

```

__model fit__ I feel comfortable about the model fit. The logit scale reveals that data can be fit onto a straight line (within a logarithmic view). 
Let's consider those people who work 30 or more hours. 
```{R}
#subset(df.ExpectCollegeNum.gradBA.sum, ExpectCollegeNum == 2)
subset(df.HoursWorked.gradBA.sum, HoursWorked == 30)
```

__estimated population proportion__
"Using the model,
  the estimated population proportion of graduating when hours worked equal 30 hours worked
  `r signif(subset(df.HoursWorked.gradBA.sum, HoursWorked == 20, fitted.values), 3)`.
We are 95\% confident that the population proportion is between
.702  and .734."

The summary table gives MLEs and standard errors for the regression parameters.
The z-value column is the parameter estimate divided by its standard error.
The p-values are used to test whether the corresponding parameters of the
logistic model are zero.

# 13 Final Poster  

1. __(1 p)__ Introduction

    * (HW02 Lit Review) 2-4 bullets describing the study, previous research.

    
*  I would like to know if working hours (categorical explanatory) during high school is associated with college expectations (categorical response). And, does parental college concern moderate this hypothesized association?

*  Secondly, I'm interested to see if levels of parental college support/concern (categorical explanatory) during high school is associated with college expectations (categorical response). 

*  A specific example I'm testing involves whether it is true that very traditional Latino parents, if low-income bracket, encourage sons to help the family by working a couple years after graduating high school.  In contrast, daughters are discouraged from being a "breadwinner." Rather, daughters are encouraged to go directly to college. Therefore, I hypothesize that working hours during adolescence is negatively associated with level of college expectation, yet this relation is conditioned by parental college concern.  

*  Based on the literature, I situate the parental association with students' college expectations within the psychology, education, and sociology peer-reviewed articles around 'family influence'.  More specifically, the publications that frame parental influence in theoretical terms of "Social Control via Family Bonding", i.e., Family Attachment. My research looks at the "dark side" of parental influence rather than the usual "protective factors." I did not find any articles so far on Latino parental conditioning of the working and college expectation relationship.

2. __(1 p)__ Research Questions

    * (HW02 Research Questions) 2 bullest, one for each research question, stated as the alternative hypothesis.

__MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION__:
Does Parental College Concern moderate (i.e. strength or direction of association) the negative assocation between working hours and college expectation among high school students? And 20 years later?

__RQ1__: What is the relationship between respondent working hours VS respondent expectation to go to college?  

__RQ2__: Does low parental concern accentuate the hypothesized association between adolescent-working hours vs college expectation? 

__RQ3__: What is the longitudinal outcome, i.e., later Wave 4 college graduation?
  
  *Research Question I. 
__H1__: I hypothesize that the Wave 4 college graduation outcome variable (probability of success) is negatively associated with working hours in high school.

__H1_alt__: I hypothesize that the Wave 4 college graduation outcome variable (probability of success) is negatively associated with working hours in high school.


  * Research Question II

4. __(1 p)__ Discussion: 
* The results support the initial hypotheses in which I expected work hours (especially if conditioned by low parental concern) to be negativately associated with work.  This finding was however contradicted by the findings for Latino Males, that behaved the opposite as others. Latino males and females, though lower parental college concern, increased in college expectations with more hours worked. 

Hispanic Males' college expectations remain high despite low parental concern, and their expectations increase with more hours worked (contrary to most other groups). 

__H_null__: found false: (categorical explanatory - HoursWorked) do not associate with college expectation, yet high parental college concern mitigates this effect.

__H1__: found correct:  Working hours (categorical explanatory - HoursWorked) during high school have negative association with college expectations (categorical response - ExpectCollege). * Latinos and Native Americans exact opposite--they increase in college expectation when hours increase. 

__H1alternative__: found false: (categorical explanatory - HoursWorked) positively associate with college expectation.

__H2__: found correct: Parenting college concern moderates the working-in-high-school and expectation-to-go-to-college relationship. 

__H2alt__: found false: There is no interaction effect between Parenting college concern and working-in-high-school in the association with expectation-to-go-to-college.  
(tested by whether conditioning from the intersection of Latino race and Male gender.)

__H3_wavefour__: found true: I hypothesize that the Wave 4 college graduation outcome variable (probability of success) is negatively associated with working hours in high school.

__H3_wavefour_alternative__: found false: I hypothesize that the Wave 4 college graduation outcome variable (probability of success) is not negatively associated with working hours in high school. Rejected--not for the expected reason--

5. __(1 p)__ RESULTS: Further directions or Future work or Next steps or something else that indicates there more to do and you've thought about it. 
    * A new alternative hypothesis presents itself: White Males are highly sensitive to parental college concerns, and their expectations actually decrease with more hours worked (contary to Latino males).  Also, at a closer look, the norm among all groups is to decrease expectations for increasing hours working. Yet, Latino males and females increase expectation. 
    * I'm interested to find out what the later education results are, which I investigate in the last section. [spoiler:] odds of graduating college improve up to five working hours, then decrease back to baseline zero hours when working ten hours. After ten hours working in high school, odds of graduating increase at 20, and increase further at 30, then

7. __(2 p)__first research question.
    * 
Do Working hours (categorical explanatory) during high school have an association with college expectations (categorical response - ExpectCollege)? moderately significant at p=.068   This means there is a slightly negative association between working hours and college expectations. 

```{R, cache = TRUE}
# fit the simple linear regression model Expectation regressed on hours worked
lm.ExpectCollegeNum.HoursWorked <- lm(ExpectCollegeNum ~ HoursWorked, data = addhealth.sub)
# use summary() to parameters estimates (slope, intercept) and other summaries
#summary(lm.ExpectCollegeNum.HoursWorked)
#addhealth.sub.latinomale <- addhealth.sub
#addhealth.sub.latinomale[LatinoMale ==]
library(ggplot2)
p5 <- ggplot(addhealth.sub, aes(x = HoursWorked, y = ExpectCollegeNum))
p5 <- p5 + geom_point(position = position_jitter(width=0.5), colour = "pink")
p5 <- p5 + stat_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +  theme_bw()
p5 <- p5 + facet_wrap(Sex ~ RaceEth)
p5 <- p5 + labs(x = "Hours Worked", y = "Expectation to Attend College", title = "Hours Worked and Expectation to attend College,\n by Gender and Age")
print(p5)
```

__(2 p)__Results for Research Question 2: Does low parental concern accentuate the hypothesized association between adolescent-working hours vs college expectation? And using the case study of Latino males? 

```{R}
t.summary.Ex <- t.test(ExpectCollegeNum ~ HighParenCollConcern, addhealth.sub)
t.summary.Ex
```

``Is the population mean college expectation different for those with High Parental Concern (HPC) or not (LPC)?''
    * $H_0: \mu_{Hi-ParConcern} = \mu_{LPC}$ versus $H_A: \mu_{HPC} \ne \mu_{Lo-ParConcern}$
Let $\alpha=0.05$, the significance level of the test and the Type-I error probability if the null hypothesis is true.
$t_{s} = `r signif(t.summary.Ex$statistic, 4)`$.
$p=`r signif(t.summary.Ex$p.value, 3)`$, this is the observed significance of the test.
Because $p=`r signif(t.summary.Ex$p.value, 3)` < 0.05$,
    we have sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$, concluding that the
   college expectations do indeed differ by parental college concern.
