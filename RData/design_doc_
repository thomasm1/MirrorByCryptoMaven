# Rubric

1. Using a numerical response variable and a two-level categorical variable (or a categorical variable you can reduce to two levels),
  specify a two-sample $t$-test associated with your research questions.
    * (2 p) Specify the hypotheses in words and notation (either one- or two-sided test),
#
    Let $\mu_i$ = pop mean Expectation to Attend College for children in group $i$, $(i=1,2,3)$.
We wish to test $H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3$ against $H_A: \textrm{not } H_0$.
#
    * (0 p) use `t.test()` to calculate the mean, test statistic, and p-value,
    
    * (3 p) state the significance level, test statistic, and p-value, and
    * (2 p) state the conclusion in the context of the problem.
    * (1 p) Given your conclusion, could you have committed at Type-I or Type-II error?
    * (2 p) Provide an appropriate plot of the data and sample estimates in a well-labelled plot.

## HW02: Literature Review

__Initial thinking__:  I'm interested in the psychological elements of parental influence on respondent expectation to go to college; specifically, whether a common observation holds true that very traditional Latino families, if low-income bracket, expect the older males to work after high school to help the family and siblings--thus a low concern/encouragement to attend college in some cases, at least for a year or two. Female Latinas are less expected to take care of the family in comparison. If so, I theoretically expect adolescent males, especially if they are older, may tend to have lower expectations to attend college at least for a year or two. 
  Thus, I hypothesize that non-summer working adolescents in high school-if male and especially if also Latino-will report a lower college-expectation score (1-5) [The college-expectation score is based on question, "how likely do you expect to go to college?"]  If it is true that there is an interactive (i.e., conditioning) effect of low parental college concern, then it may imply (absent of unknown spurious explanatory factors) that cultural practice plays a moderating role in the low-income adolescent's expectation to go to college if their parent is not enthusiastic or concerned about college in a pro-education way.  

__H1a__: High concern of parent for college attend, positive assoc with respondant's expectation.
__H1b__: Disconcern--even antipathy--of parent for college attend, negative assoc with respondent's      expectation.
__Educational Reproduction__
__H2a__: Low-income positive association with Working
__H2b__: High-income negative association with Working ~0hrs
__H2c__: Middle and high number of hours negative association with college expectation.
__H2d__: Zero to five hours/week positive association wih college expectation. 
__SUM Hyp__: Therefore, I will look at the association between number of working hours while in high school and the respondent's expectation to attend college.  The variable of interest is parenting college concern, which mediates the working-in-high-school and expectation-to-go-to-college relationship, especially when conditioned by the intersection of Latino race and Male gender.
  
  __Topic of interest__: I am interested in the association between parental college concern and student college-attendance expectation,and how it may be affected by student ethnicity, SES, age, gender, GPA-status, and other factors.   College expectation is much more accurate than college "aspiration" because the term connotes desire and wish; it also reflects moral or social self-identity according to some researchers.  I'm also and how it may be affected by student ethnicity, SES, age, gender, GPA-status, and other factors.   Note: I truly wished to include analysis of respondent's peers' behavior and attitudes, which is  available through related network dataset. It is not feasible to use this nomination-generated friend data.  
  
  __MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION__:
H3 Does Parental College Concern moderate (i.e. strength or direction of association) the negative assocation between working and college expectation among high school students?

__RQ_1__: What is the relationship between respondent non-summer working VS respondent expectation to go to college?  
__RQ_2__: What is the relationship between parental college concern VS respondent expectation to go to college?
__RQ-3__: Does parental college concern change relationship? In other words, does low parental concern accentuate the hypothesized association between adolescent-working hours vs college expectation? 
  
__How I did it__: Using Codebook of AddHealth_Wave1 literature review via Mendeley, Extensive use of AddHealthW1_CodeBook.pdf

__Literature Review Recap__:Starting with Frank Furstenbur2000), whose authoritative coverage of adolescence research works with Education-core authors and particular works, including, Stanton-Salazar (1997), Pascarelli (1998), Buchmann (1989), Brooks-Gunn & Graber (1994), Steinberg, Lamborn, Darling & Dornbusch (1994), Entwisle & Alexander (1993) and so on.  
__Final Lit Note__: Based on the literature, I situate the parental effect on students' college expectations within psych/ed/soc journals on family influence.  More specifically, the publications that frame parental influence in theoretical terms of "Social Control via Family Bonding", i.e., Family Attachment.

AgeYearMos <- AgeYear*12
head(AgeYearMos)

head(AgeMonth)
AgeYearsMonths <- AgeYearMos + AgeMonth
head(AgeYearsMonths)
Age <- AgeYearsMonths/12

BirthDayX <-rep(15, 6504)
addhealth.sub$BirthDayX <- BirthDayX
date.sub <- subset(addhealth.sub, select = c(SurveyDay, SurveyMonth, SurveyYear, BirthDayX, BirthMonth, BirthYear))
str(date.sub)
```
####Combine the date fields together, then interpret them into a date object.
I'll do this for both the interview date and the date of birth.
I print the head (first 6 observations) after each operation.
```{R}
library(lubridate)
## interview date
# combinemonth, and year into one text string
cdate.text <- paste(date.sub$SurveyDay, date.sub$SurveyMonth,date.sub$SurveyYear)
head(cdate.text)
# create date object by interpretting the day, month, year with dmy()
cdate.date <- dmy(cdate.text)
head(cdate.date)
## date of birth
# combine day, month, and year into one text string
dob.text <- paste(date.sub$BirthDayX, date.sub$BirthMonth, date.sub$BirthYear)
head(dob.text)
dob.date <- dmy(dob.text)
head(dob.date)
```
####Now that we have the interview date and date of birth as date objects,  we calculate the difference to give the person's age at the time of the interview.Because the difference of dates is in the unit "days", we convert to years.
```{R}
# difference in days / 365.25 = difference in years
str(cdate.date)
age.days <- cdate.date - dob.date
head(age.days)
age.years <- as.numeric(age.days / 365.25)  # change from "difftime" to "numeric"
head(age.years)
# difference between the age we calculated and the age in the original dataset

## Variable for the person's age in years  based on the person's date of birth and the interview date.
There is an `AGE` variable which I'm already using,  but if there wasn't, or I wanted to be more precise about their age (such as, 24.34 years old),
  then this is a way to do it.
I'm going to create a separate data frame just for this example to show how to do it;
  if you needed these variables, they should be part of your original subset above.
Below, the "C" variables (`CDAY`) are the interview day, month, and year,
  and the "DOB" variables (`DOBD`) are the date of birth dat, month, and year.

### Coding missing values
```{R, cache = TRUE}

#summary(addhealth.sub$Sex)
#addhealth.sub$Sex[addhealth.sub$Sex == NA] <- 0
# Next, replace any values that are "6" with NA
addhealth.sub$Sex[addhealth.sub$Sex == 6] <- NA
summary(addhealth.sub$Sex)
# Then drop unused factor categories.
addhealth.sub$Sex <- factor(addhealth.sub$Sex)[, drop = TRUE]
summary(addhealth.sub$Sex)

#DesireCollege
#str(addhealth.sub$DesireCollege)

addhealth.sub$DesireCollege[addhealth.sub$DesireCollege == 6] <- NA
addhealth.sub$DesireCollege[addhealth.sub$DesireCollege == 8] <- NA
#summary(addhealth.sub$DesireCollege)
addhealth.sub$DesireCollege <- factor(addhealth.sub$DesireCollege)[, drop = TRUE]
summary(addhealth.sub$DesireCollege)

#ExpectCollege

#summary(addhealth.sub$ExpectCollege)
addhealth.sub$ExpectCollege <- factor(addhealth.sub$ExpectCollege)[, drop = TRUE]

### The results fundamentally contradict the initial hypotheses that  not only proved wrong, but the exact opposite is convincingly demonstrated: Hispanic Males' college expectations remain high despite low parental concern, and their expectations increase with more hours worked (contrary to all other groups). Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected--not for the expected reason--and further, a new alternative hypothesis presents itself: White Males are highly sensitive to parental college concerns, and their expectations actually decrease with more hours worked (contary to Latinos). 
### Also, at a closer look, the norm among all groups is to decrease expectations for increasing hours working. Yet, Latino males and females increase expectation.

##### My personal interpretation of this graph is that the more hours worked, less expectation to attend college. This association is accentuated by male gender.

#### Hours Worked versus Expectation to Attend College, Conditioned by Gender and Parental College Concern (1-5)
```{R, cache = TRUE}
ggplot(data = na.omit(addhealth.sub), aes(x = HoursWorkedCat, fill = ExpectCollege)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme_bw() + facet_grid(Sex ~ ParentConcernM) +
  theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(angle = 85, vjust = 1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 80) +
  labs(x = "Hours Worked", y = "Proportion of \bthose Expecting College", title = "Hours Worked versus \n Expectation to Attend College, \n Conditioned by Gender and *pictured below*, \n Parental College Concern 1-5") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name="Student's \nExpectation to \nAttend College")
```
##### My personal intepretation of this tells me that Males (1) are less likely to expect college than females (2), generally speaking. Those working more hours expect to go to college to a lesser degree, and moreso males than females in this respect.  Finally, Looking at parental concern, it has a large effect on expectation to go to college.

## HW 06
1. With your previous (or new) bivariate scatter plot, calculate the correlation and interpret.
    * (1 p) plot is repeated here or the plot is referenced an easy to find from a plot above,
    * (1 p) correlation is calculated,
    * (2 p) correlation is interpretted (direction, strength of LINEAR relationship).
#### 
### Combined correlation between parental college concern and student's expectation to attend college is .321;This implies that there is a positive relationship, albeit weak correlation. The correlation is stronger for males at .357 than females at .29. This is expected according to the theory that Parental influence is associated with College expectation. 
### Next, the same relationship (corr = .321) is compared by working status. The correlation is stronger for those working (.339) than those not working (.301)
### Next, expectation to attend college 

#### Why is there a difference in the strength of the correlation for everyone compared to either gender separately?  
#####Although the scale is smaller by gender, the correlative association is almost identical at ~.55 or ~.56, Doubling N, leads to combined much stronger .765.  

2. With your previous (or new) two- or three-variable categorical plot, calculate conditional proportions and interpret.
    * (1 p) frequency table of variables is given,
          * It appears that interestingly it is 
    * (2 p) conditional proportion tables are calculated of the outcome variable conditional on one or two other variables,
    * (1 p) a well-labelled plot of the proportion table is given,
    * (2 p) the conditional proportions are interpretted and compared between conditions.
         The tables are less helpful but begin to provide some interesting results in that Expectation to attend college is only a little stronger among those not working.  Similarly it is extremely important to find that there are plenty of self-defining "non-working" students that actually log up to 10 hours working...so now I may have to consider making a subset of specifically working or non-working students. By race, it becomes evident that Natives are much more sensitive to their parents' concern about college at lower levels while White students much less so.

## HW 07 Parameter Estimation

1. Using your dataset's description and/or codebook, briefly describe how the data were collected (the sampling strategy).
    * (ANSWER) The Add Health design employs a clustered sampling design in which the wider network of in-school surveys comprise the "core" sample, while the "saturated" samples collect in-home information from the entire HS student population. This strategy facilitates the oversampled minority and rare groups, in addition to peer network data enabling social network analysis (SNA). 
  * (ANSWER) The source of the information is the official website of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health: Social, Behavioral, and Biological Linkages Across the Life Course. http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/faqs/aboutdata
    * (ANSWER) The Wave I stategy employed a stratified, over-sampled design so as to capture sufficient sampling of minority and rare groups. For example, 1038 African American students from well-educated families--with a parent with a college degree. 334 Chinese, 450 Cuban, 437 Puerto Rican.
    * (ANSWER) Potential issues (estimation bias, etc) may be a result of this collection strategy: 
The strategy used to protect against potential sampling issues has a couple of potential bias issues that arise. First, students and parents were alerted beforehand of the date of survey and some parents could have potentially pulled their students thereby self-selection (out) of the sample. 
    * Second, the "saturated" schools--that interviewed every student and parents at the home--were mostly (14 of 16) small-sized (n < 300 students). This type of data doesn't portray most of the stuffy, packed, busy high schools that overrun public schools. The 1994 data also mostly misses the rise and diversity of charter schooling. Besides these petty pedagogical points, the data is nationally representative. 

2. Using either a numerical variable or a two-level categorical variable, calculate and interpret a confidence interval for the population mean or proportion.
    * The variable of college expectation is the outcome variable of interest. It is a discrete-interval numerical variable along the scale from nominal, ordinal, discrete-interval, and continuous-ratio. In the case of this variable.
    
    * `t.test()` or `binom.test()` used to calculate the mean and confidence interval.   
    * ANSWER: Running a simple t-test, the mean of x is 4.312 and the 95% Confidence Interval lies between 4.274 and 4.35. This is given a t of 223, df of 3002 and p-value < 2.23-16. 
    
    * Confidence interval.  ANSWER: The CI indicates that it is fairly clear that there is a narrow CI. I am confident that such a narrow measurement may be useful to compare with the confidence interval of only those students' expectations with working status (to be investigated below)
    * Plot of the data, estimate, and confidence interval in a single well-labelled plot.

```{R}
t.result <- t.test(addhealth.sub$ExpectCollegeNum, conf.level = 0.95)  #$
t.result
```
The sample mean of the $($College Expectation$)$ is `r signif(t.result$estimate, 3)`.
We are 95% confident that the population mean is between
`r signif(t.result$conf.int[1], 3)` and
`r signif(t.result$conf.int[2], 3)`.


```{R, cache = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(addhealth.sub, aes(x = ExpectCollegeNum))
p <- p + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, alpha = 1)
p <- p + geom_rug(alpha = 1/8)

p <- p + labs(x = "Expectation to Attend College", title = "College Expectation \nblue = est +- 95% CI")

## HW08
### Two-sample $t$-test: `ExpectCollegeNum` by `HighParenCollConcern`


1. Using a numerical response variable and a two-level categorical variable (or a categorical variable you can reduce to two levels),
  specify a two-sample $t$-test associated with your research questions.
    * (2 p) Specify the hypotheses in words and notation (either one- or two-sided test),  AnNSWER: RQ Is the population mean college expectation different for those with High Parental College Concern (HPC) or not (i.e., non-HPC)?
    * (0 p) use `t.test()` to calculate the mean, test statistic, and p-value: 
    * (3 p) state the significance level, test statistic, and p-value, 
    ANSWER: Sample mean of low parental concern (defined as < 4):   `Mu_{non-HPC}` = 3.528.  The `Mu_{HPC}` High Parental Concern group's mean score is 4.46 (expectation to attend college, scale of 1-5). ,the test statistic is t = -14.128.  P-value < 2.2e-16. So we're sure that those that do not have high parental support are between -1 and -.8 difference of mean expectation, at least according to the Welch Two Sample t-test.
    * (2 p) state the conclusion in the context of the problem.  The real answers to this is that a clear indication justifying the rejecting of the null hypothesis, stating that expecation does not differ between those with high parental college support and those with low parental college support 
    * (1 p) Given your conclusion, could you have committed at Type-I or Type-II error?  ANSWER: Had I done nothing and failed to reject the null--either through complacency or complicity--I would commit a type-II error. 
    * (2 p) Provide an appropriate plot of the data and sample estimates in a well-labelled plot.

1. ``Is the population mean college expectation different for those with High Parental Concern (HPC) or not (LPC)?''
    * $H_0: \mu_{HPC} = \mu_{LPC}$ versus $H_A: \mu_{HPC} \ne \mu_{LPC}$

2. Let $\alpha=0.05$, the significance level of the test and the Type-I error probability if the null hypothesis is true.

3. $t_{s} = `r signif(t.summary.TCS.D$statistic, 4)`$.

4. $p=`r signif(t.summary.TCS.D$p.value, 3)`$, this is the observed significance of the test.

5. Because $p=`r signif(t.summary.TCS.D$p.value, 3)` < 0.05$,
    we have sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$, concluding that the
   college expectations do indeed differ by parental college concern.

Final Conclusion: Because I rejected $H_0$ on overwhelming evidence to reject the null, I would have committed a Type-II error (that there is a difference and I failed to announce it to the research community). I also know that there is 3.62×10???39 likelihood that I'm committing a type I error--given an alpha coefficient of 05.  (that there is no difference and my announcement is a spurious finding (which only confuses the research community)).

# Rubric

1. Using a numerical response variable and a categorical variable with three to five levels (or a categorical variable you can reduce to three to five levels),
  specify an ANOVA hypothesis associated with your research questions.

print(p)
```
-->
(1 p) Describe the plot of residuals as it relates to model assumptions. ANSWER: ANOVA Model assumptions require that the population have equal spreads evidenced by heavy tails and skews and that the population curve be normal. Since the residuals reveal a relatively normal curve of the sample. In fact, this distribution would almost resemble a sample from a known "normal" population. Comparing the ideal with our own sample distrbution, this is sufficiently normal to proceed.


- Plot the residuals versus the normal quantiles.
  If the residuals are normal, then the will fall on the center line and
  very few will be outside the error bands.

```{R}
# QQ plot
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
library(car)
qqPlot(fit.c$residuals, las = 1, id.n = 0, id.cex = 1, lwd = 1, main="QQ Plot")
```

(1 p) Describe the plot of residuals as it relates to model assumptions.
ANSWER: So, here the distribution looks good with only a couple outliers at the left tail. 



- A formal test of normality on the residuals tests the hypothesis
  $H_0:$ The distribution is Normal vs
  $H_1:$ The distribution is not Normal.
We can test the distribution of the residuals.

Three tests for normality are reported below.
I tend to like the Anderson-Darling test.
Different tests have different properties, and
  tests that are sensitive to differences from normality in the tails of the
  distribution are typically more important for us (since deviations in the tails
  are more influential than deviations in the center).

```{R}
shapiro.test(fit.c$residuals)
library(nortest)
ad.test(fit.c$residuals)
cvm.test(fit.c$residuals)
```

(1 p) Interpret the conclusion of the Anderson-Darling test.  ANSWER: Firstly, we can use the test because there is not a heavy left or heavy right tail, or any other problem.  The AD test reveals the P-value is .1449. This is not problematic because it is normal .. no need for other tests. In this case, we want to reject the null hypothesis, so we desire > .05 for p-value.






* Check whether populations have equal variances.

- Look at the numerical summaries below.

```{R}
# calculate summaries
library(plyr)
chds.summary <- ddply(addhealth.sub, "",
     function(X) { data.frame( m = mean(X$c_bwt),
                               s = sd(X$c_bwt),
                               n = length(X$c_bwt) ) } )
chds.summary
```

(1 p) Interpret the standard deviations above.  You may also discuss the plots of the data.
ANSWER: The stand deviation increases slightly with more smoking groups. 

- Formal tests for equal variances.
We can test whether the variances are equal between our three groups.
This is similar to the ANOVA hypothesis, but instead of testing means we're tesing variances.
$H_0: \sigma^2_1=\sigma^2_2=\sigma^2_3$
versus $H_A: \textrm{not } H_0$ (at least one pair of variances differ).

```{R}
## Test equal variance
# assumes populations are normal
bartlett.test(c_bwt ~ smoke, data = chds)

# does not assume normality, requires car package
library(car)
leveneTest(c_bwt ~ smoke, data = chds)

# nonparametric test
fligner.test(c_bwt ~ smoke, data = chds)
```

(1 p) Interpret the result of the appropriate test.
If normality was reasonable then use Bartlett, otherwise use Levene.

ANSWER: Using the Bartlett due to normal distribution, the test indicates p-value of .8583. (P-value is derived from 'area under the chi-squared curve to the right of B obs.) In this case again we do not want to reject the null hypothesis (which is normality).

7. If the ANOVA null hypothesis was rejected, then perform follow-up Post Hoc
  pairwise comparison tests to determine which pairs of means are different.

There are several multiple comparison methods described in the notes.
Let's use Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD) here to test which pairs of
populations differ.
```{R}
## Add Health
# Tukey 95% Individual p-values
TukeyHSD(fit.c)
```

(2 p) Interpret the comparisons (which pairs differ).
ANSWER: According to Tukey's Honest Signicant Difference test, We see the three comparisons of the three groups, and clearly the pairs with a '0-cig' are much more different than the other two pairs. Therefore, group 0-cigs diffs greatly from the others.


(1 p) Summarize results by ordering the means and grouping pairs that do not differ (see notes for examples).

```
Replace this example with your results.

  Example:  [0=cigs and 20+] AND [0+ and 1-19] groups differ, but group pairing 20+ and 1-19 is not different from either.
    (These groups are ordered by mean, so A has the lowest mean and C has the highest.)
These groups are ordered by mean, so that 0-cigs is lowest, and 1-19 is highest
    0=cigs     20+   1-19
    ------     ----------------
